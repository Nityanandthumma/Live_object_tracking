# 🔍 YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking

This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision system using **YOLOv8** and **ByteTrack** for live **object detection and tracking** with a webcam feed. Built using Python and OpenCV, the system is capable of detecting multiple object classes and assigning unique IDs to track them across frames.
